# html.c

Simple library to render HTML in C, using a [domain-specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
based on the C preprocessor, without any external dependencies. Currently
a work-in-progress.

## Credits and licensing
All credit goes to the amazing article _[Syntactic sugar in C - (ab)using "for" loops](https://zserge.com/posts/c-for-loop-tricks/)_
by @zserge, since this library is just an extension of what's described
in the article. The license is probably going to be MIT once it's released.
